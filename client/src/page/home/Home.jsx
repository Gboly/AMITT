      Few years ago I was lost, bored, with no direction and a clear path to my
      career. So I wanted a change and get a grips before all falls apart for
      me. . I always wanted to work in Financial Service Industry where it is
      challenging, possibility is endless and I can fulfill my potentials but
      finding it difficult to get in. The training program has giving me the
      break through, thanks to God; Specifically the collateral management
      world. Here things are very volatile, where no day is the same and you
      face different challenges in a fast pace environment that is only
      guaranteed to build you and let you grow with enormous opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      With no experience in the banking world at the time, I remember I embarked
      on a 3 months weekend training programme in the collateral world and the
      rest is history. Thanks to this training programme, I got my first offer
      within the three months of the training and years still counting, I have
      worked and still working in some of the biggest banks in the city, earning
      great, being comfortable and fulfilling my dreams and my life changed
      positively forever. Not bad for someone who looked lost with so direction
      and almost ready to pack it all up.
